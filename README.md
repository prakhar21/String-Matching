# String-Matching

This Repo deals with many String Matching / Metric Algorithms and their implementaion in Python 2.7

#### [Rabin Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)  / [Lavenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) / [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) / [Affine  Gap Penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_penalty)

* `main.py` : The main code containing all the above mentioned algorithms.

#### Below are some algorithms that you can mention as argument
`-karp` `-hamming` `-laven` `-affinegap`
###### Below command runs the code for string mathcing considering Rabin karp as the algorithm.
`> python main.py -algo -karp -s1 Today is monday -s2 onday` 

#### Feel free to send any questions by raising an issue.
